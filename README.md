## I. Executive Summary ##

This comprehensive study delves into the intricate relationships between various environmental factors, such as resource depletion, emissions, and air pollution, and crucial health indicators, including fertility rate, disease prevalence, and mortality rate. By analyzing extensive datasets and employing advanced statistical techniques, the study reveals significant correlations that underscore the profound impact of environmental conditions on public health.

Preliminary findings indicate that Carbon Dioxide Damage is negatively correlated with Female Survival to Age 65 (-0.70) and Life Expectancy (-0.61), suggesting a direct detrimental effect of increased carbon emissions on female longevity and overall life expectancy. Similarly, Annual Freshwater Withdrawals show a positive correlation with Adult Male Mortality Rate (0.60), highlighting the adverse consequences of excessive water use on male mortality. Methane Emissions are negatively correlated with Male Survival to Age 65 (-0.56), indicating that higher methane levels reduce male survival rates.

Cross-validation using various regression models, including linear regression, regression trees, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression, revealed that environmental factors significantly influence health outcomes, though these relationships are often complex and non-linear. Key findings include:

Death Rate: Significantly impacted by carbon dioxide damage, CO2 emissions, and methane emissions.

* Life Expectancy: Influenced by net forest depletion and mineral depletion, alongside other factors such as energy depletion and natural resource depletion.

* Fertility Rate: Primarily affected by particulate emission damage, net forest depletion, and mineral depletion.

* Mortality from CVD, Cancer, Diabetes, or CRD: Strongly influenced by nitrous oxide emissions, water stress, and air pollution.

In conclusion, the study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to implement stricter regulations on emissions and resource depletion to safeguard public health. Future research should aim to explore the combined effects of environmental and demographic factors on health outcomes, utilizing more sophisticated analytical techniques and comprehensive datasets.
